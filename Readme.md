# National Parks Guide
Jason King [https://jsnkng.com]


Abstract
I designed and built National Parks guide as an example of a Next.js progressive web app (PWA). Comprised of 2-layers plus the NPS.gov api, the frontend is React-based and written around functional components. The backend is accessible via a node.js api which itself provides caching functionality for the official NPS api by way of a MongoDB instance and an AWS S3 bucket.
